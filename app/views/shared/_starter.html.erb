        The moment you push that button.. you have <strong>20 minutes</strong> of undivided, razor-sharp, 
        mind-thumping focus on whatever task you in the box above. 
        You will concentrate and master <strong>only</strong> what you write in that box. 
        When the 20 minutes is up, your mind is free to wander in the meadows of idleness amongst
         the daisies of self-congratulations. <br />
